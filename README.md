# Arctic Apricity
A beautiful, modern gnome-shell theme, used in Apricity OS. Original git repository: https://github.com/agajews/ArcticApricity

I really like this theme, and add some fixes:

Fixed inactive items color in popup menus, added switches from Arc theme (default Apricity OS gtk+ theme):

And changed topbar color to rgb(0,0,0):
